## Key Findings

* There were a total of 353,894 trips taken in 2018.
* There are 11 trips with a rider birthdate of 1887. Unless there is a 131 year-old riding bikes, the birthdate is a typo. All 11 trips are likely the same individual, as the majority start from the Newport PATH station and end at the Columbus Drive station.
* On the Trip Duration v Birthyear graph, there is a huge spike in trip duration by users born in 1969. The number of 1969 entries on the Count of Birth Year histogram also appears to be an outlier. It is difficult to determine the source of this discrepancy without being able to link specific trips to individual members. There could be a small number of people born in 1969 who are taking an inordinate number of trips, or there could be tons of people born in 1969 that each take a few trips. Perhaps there is a staff member who was born in 1969 who is moving bikes around, however citibike claims to exclude such instances. Or, maybe someone born in 1969 has a delivery business and uses citibike. 
* From the Station Popularity graph, we can see that the most popular station to start from is the Grove St PATH station. Other popular stations include the Exchange Place, Hamilton Park, and Sip Ave.
* The most popular months to rent bikes are July and August. Rentals begin tapering off in September and don't start to increase again until January. 
* From our gender breakdown graph, we see that males took over three times the number of trips as females.
* Peak rental times remain consistent throughout the year, with most bike rentals occurring around 8 am and 6 pm. 
* The average number of total miles ridden per day is 95,877. June is the most popular month to ride bikes while January is the least popular. 
* Total membership increased by 17% in in 2018.
